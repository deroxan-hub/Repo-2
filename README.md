#Kariuki Kimotho
A simple and fun calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input numbers. 

## Features ✨
- Takes two numbers as input (supports decimals! )
- Performs the following operations:
  - **Addition** (`num1 + num2`) ➕
  - **Subtraction** (`num1 - num2`) ➖
  - **Multiplication** (`num1 * num2`) ✖️
  - **Division** (`num1 / num2`) ➗ (Note: Division by zero will crash the program! 🚫)
- Prints the results in a fun and readable format. 

## How to Use 
1. Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. The calculator will display the results of all four operations.

### Example Input/Output:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
